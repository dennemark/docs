This guide shows how to identify and optimize query performance, debug performance issues, and address common challenges.

## Debugging performance issues

Several common practices can lead to slow queries and performance problems, such as:

- Over-fetching data
- Missing indexes
- Not caching repeated queries
- Performing full table scans

:::info

For more potential causes of performance issues, visit [this page](/optimize/recommendations).

:::

[Prisma Optimize](/optimize) offers [recommendations](/optimize/recommendations) to identify and address the inefficiencies listed above and more, helping to boost query performance.

To get started, follow the [integration guide](/optimize/getting-started) and add Prisma Optimize to your project to begin diagnosing slow queries.

:::tip

You can also [log query events at the client level](/orm/prisma-client/observability-and-logging/logging#event-based-logging) to view the generated queries, their parameters, and execution times.

If you are particularly focused on monitoring query duration, consider using [logging middleware](/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions/middleware/logging-middleware).
